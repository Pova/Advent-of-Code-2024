# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)! This repository contains my attempts at solving the daily programming puzzles using Python.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:


### 1. `real_inputs/`
This folder contains the actual input data for each day, downloaded from the Advent of Code website. Files are labeled as:
- `day_01.txt`
- `day_02.txt`
- ...

### 2. `test_inputs/`
This folder contains smaller test inputs used to verify the solutions before running them on the real inputs. Files are labeled similarly:
- `day_01.txt`
- `day_02.txt`
- ...

### 3. `solutions/`
This folder contains Python scripts with the solution code for each day's puzzle. Files are named as:
- `day_01.py`
- `day_02.py`
- ...

Each script expects the corresponding input file from the `real_inputs/` or `test_inputs/` folder.

## How to Run the Solutions

To run a specific day's solution:
1. Navigate to the `solutions/` directory.
2. Run the corresponding Python script using the command:

   ```bash
   python day_<XX>.py
